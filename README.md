# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
This project applies foundational and intermediate Python skills to explore and analyze Netflix movie data as part of DataCamp's Associate Data Scientist Pro track. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), I uncovered insights about movies from a specific decade, helping a hypothetical production company make data-driven decisions. The analysis includes data manipulation, visualization, and key trend identification.

**Netflix**! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex your exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry.

You work for a production company that specializes in nostalgic styles. You want to do some research on movies released in the 1990's. You'll delve into Netflix data and perform exploratory data analysis to better understand this awesome movie decade!
