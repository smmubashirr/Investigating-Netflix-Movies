# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
This project applies foundational and intermediate Python skills to explore and analyze Netflix movie data as part of DataCamp's Associate Data Scientist Pro track. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), I uncovered insights about movies from a specific decade, helping a hypothetical production company make data-driven decisions. The analysis includes data manipulation, visualization, and key trend identification.
